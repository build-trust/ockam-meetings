# Ockam Community meetings

Information on open Ockam Community meetings. Each meeting has its own agenda which
is published before the meeting. Minutes will be posted in the agenda document after
the meeting concludes, including topics discussed, decisions made, and future items
for discussion.

We plan to follow a similar format to that of the WebAssembly Community Group, which is
itself based on standards meetings. If you aren't familiar with how such meetings work,
[this paper on standards committee participation for newbies](http://wirfs-brock.com/allen/files/papers/standpats-asianplop2016.pdf)
is worth a look!

We differ from the standards process in that Ockam reserves final say on decisions pertaining
to its products, but our hope is that by involving the community from start to finish, we can
find broad consensus on decisions that are made.

There is also discussion happening in [Ockam's Community on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/ockam-network/ockam/discussions)

## Process

### Attendance

Meetings will be announced in advance via PR on this repository. The announcement will include
meeting details, such as the Zoom meeting URL, date/time, etc. It will also include the agenda
for the meeting, which can be extended by opening a PR with the topic you wish to have put on
the agenda.

**Meetings recur on the last Wednesday of every month at 1pm Pacific Local Time.**

### Meetings

Meetings will follow this rough outline:

- Introduce attendees
- Quick status update from Ockam
- Review the agenda, determine if changes are required, and agree on them if any are proposed
- Walk through the agenda, item by item
- Determine any action items and/or future agenda topics
- Wrap up

### Agenda

Agenda items can be added by anyone, by opening a PR against the meeting announcement and
adding your item to the list.

If an agenda item is a proposed feature, or other significant change, the champion of that
proposal should include any reference material needed for other attendees to prepare. It is
not acceptable to propose an agenda item that requires preparation less than 7 days prior to
the next meeting; such proposals should go under the list of future agenda items.

### Code Of Conduct

See our code of conduct [here](https://www.ockam.io/learn/guides/team/conduct/).

It is expected that all community members follow the code of conduct. If you feel that there
have been violations of the code of conduct, please reach out to Ockam directly.
